# Structure of the Brain

High degree of localization / segregation and differentiated specialization — each region of the brain has individual function though the whole brain lights up for each activity. There is further localization within each region as certain circuit motifs and types of neurons exist. The different types of neurons feed forward and backword synchronously with large diversity in form and function. 

Evolution is variation followed by selection and, though the architecture occurs by chance, you can't explain it any more than the coastline of Norway. The structure adapts to the nature of the world (you become what you do) — the brain is molded by experience for faster performance. If there are principles that guide this selection, those who are looking for it are more likely to find it!
