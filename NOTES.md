# Theoretical & Computational Neuroscience

#### 1. SINGLE NEURONS
- Biophysics of spike generation and action potential propagation 
- Neural coding and decoding –models of neural response, spike-triggered characterizations of response
- Measuring neural information
- Adaptation of neural responses 
- Normative models of function 

#### 2. NEURAL POPULATIONS
- Receptive field maps 
- Parallel Channels 
- Correlations and interactions 
- Network structure and computation 
 

#### 3. HIGHER LEVEL FUNCTIONS
- Memory – the Hopfield model 
- Decision making and Bayesian analysis
