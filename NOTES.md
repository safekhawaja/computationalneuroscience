## Structure of the Brain

High degree of localization / segregation and differentiated specialization — each region of the brain has individual function though the whole brain lights up for each activity. There is further localization within each region as certain circuit motifs and types of neurons exist. The different types of neurons feed forward and backword synchronously with large diversity in form and function. 

Evolution is variation followed by selection and, though the architecture occurs by chance, you can't explain it any more than the coastline of Norway. The structure adapts to the nature of the world (you become what you do) — the brain is molded by experience for faster performance. If there are principles that guide this selection, those who are looking for it are more likely to find it!

## Neurons: The Computational Units of the Brain

The brain is an extremely complex circuit made up of neurons: the circuit elements. There are other elements such as glia perform support functions. THe key specialization of neurons are the electrically excitable membranes through potential differences that allow them to generate circuits. There are also morphological specializations (shapes) that help — dendrites, the input wires or psynapses, can be proximal or distal; the axon is the output wire that branches into the axonal arbor that is made of hundreds of psynapes. Using 2% of bodyweight but 20% of metabolic power, there is almost 4km of wire in the brain!

The psynapes have ion channels that adjust the open voltage across the cleff (there are many!) as well as pumps that maintain a concentration gradient that upholds this potential. THe pumps use ATP to restore the ionic concentration, which is where most energy is spent. 

- **Hyperpolarization:** when positive ions flow out, the membrane potential becomes more negative.

- **Depolarization:** when negative ions flow out, the membrane potential becomes more postive.

- **Action Potentials** (signal spikes) occurs when membrane voltages increase to threshold value to sufficiently trigger neuro-transmitter responses. They're almost 1ms wide! E.g. K+ rushes out of a suffieicntly positive voltage to restore the potential, then pumps restore ion concentration.
